 # ML BUILDER TOOLKIT (Working Name)

**Version:** v1.0.0

⚡ *Note: “ML BUILDER TOOLKIT” is just a placeholder — the name will change in future updates.*

---

## ✨ What is this?

Angler ML (working name) is a local no-code ML lab designed to help you **draft**, **tweak**, and **export** machine learning pipelines — completely offline.

No more writing the same code over and over just to test different splits, hyperparameters, or new data versions. Build your first model, tune it visually, re-run your experiments, then export clean Python code (or a starter API, coming soon).

Built in C++ and Python for max performance — made for students, indie devs, and anyone who wants to *experiment locally* without burning cloud credits.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ Train regression, classification & clustering models (Linear Regression, KNN, Ridge, SVR*)

✅ Preprocess CSVs & handle common data cleaning tasks

✅ Basic predictions, plots & metrics

✅ Save trained models (basic version)

✅ Export your full pipeline as Python code

✅ Built-in logs for easy debugging

> *Features like deep learning, advanced hyperparameter tuning & multi-model lab splits are planned for upcoming versions.*

## 📝 **Known Limitations (v1.0)**

- Saved models cannot yet be reloaded for reuse *(coming in v1.2)*.
- No save reminder on exit — save your project manually *(coming in v1.2)*.
- No hyperparameter tuning UI yet *(coming in v1.2)*.
